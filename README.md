# How to HTTP request

<details>

<summary>JavaScript</summary>

To make an HTTP request in JavaScript, you can use the built-in `XMLHttpRequest` object or the more modern `fetch` API. Here's an example of both approaches:



Using XMLHttpRequest:

```javascript
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('GET', 'https://api.example.com/data', true); // Specify the HTTP method and URL
xhr.onreadystatechange = function () {
  if (xhr.readyState === 4 && xhr.status === 200) { // Check if the request is complete and successful
    var response = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText); // Process the response data
    console.log(response);
  }
};
xhr.send(); // Send the request
```

Using fetch API (promises-based):

```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(function (response) {
    if (response.ok) {
      return response.json(); // Parse the response data as JSON
    }
    throw new Error('Network response was not ok.');
  })
  .then(function (data) {
    console.log(data); // Process the data
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
```

Both approaches allow you to perform various types of requests (GET, POST, etc.) by adjusting the method parameter and adding additional options or data as needed.

<summary>C#</summary>


In C#, you can make HTTP requests using the `HttpClient` class, which provides a simple and efficient way to send HTTP requests and handle responses. Here's an example of making an HTTP GET request:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main()
    {
        HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
        
        try
        {
            HttpResponseMessage response = await client.GetAsync("https://api.example.com/data");
            
            response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode(); // Ensure a successful response
            
            string responseBody = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
            
            // Process the response body
            Console.WriteLine(responseBody);
        }
        catch (HttpRequestException e)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Error: " + e.Message);
        }
        
        client.Dispose(); // Clean up HttpClient resources
    }
}
```

In the above example, we create an instance of `HttpClient` and use the `GetAsync` method to send an HTTP GET request to the specified URL. The `await` keyword is used to asynchronously wait for the response.

After receiving the response, we call `EnsureSuccessStatusCode` to ensure that the response is successful (status code in the 2xx range). Then, we read the response body using `ReadAsStringAsync` and process it as needed.

Make sure to include the necessary `using` statements for the required namespaces (`System` and `System.Net.Http`) at the beginning of your code.

<summary>C++</summary>


In C++, you can make HTTP requests using various libraries such as cURL or Boost.Beast. Here's an example of making an HTTP GET request using cURL:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <curl/curl.h>

int main()
{
    CURL* curl;
    CURLcode res;
    
    curl_global_init(CURL_GLOBAL_DEFAULT);
    curl = curl_easy_init();
    
    if (curl)
    {
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://api.example.com/data");
        
        res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
        
        if (res != CURLE_OK)
        {
            std::cerr << "curl_easy_perform() failed: " << curl_easy_strerror(res) << std::endl;
        }
        
        curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
    }
    
    curl_global_cleanup();
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we include the necessary header files, initialize cURL using `curl_global_init`, and create a cURL handle using `curl_easy_init`.

We set the URL for the request using `curl_easy_setopt` with the `CURLOPT_URL` option. In this case, we set it to `"https://api.example.com/data"`.

To perform the request, we call `curl_easy_perform` with the cURL handle. If the request is successful, it will return `CURLE_OK`. Otherwise, we output an error message using `curl_easy_strerror`.

Afterwards, we clean up the cURL handle using `curl_easy_cleanup` and call `curl_global_cleanup` to clean up global cURL resources.

Note that to compile and link against cURL, you need to have the cURL library installed on your system and include the appropriate cURL header files and library during the build process. The steps for building and linking against cURL may vary depending on your platform and development environment.

<summary>C</summary>


In C, you can make HTTP requests using libraries such as cURL or libcurl. Here's an example of making an HTTP GET request using libcurl:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <curl/curl.h>

int main()
{
    CURL *curl;
    CURLcode res;

    curl_global_init(CURL_GLOBAL_DEFAULT);
    curl = curl_easy_init();

    if (curl)
    {
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://api.example.com/data");

        res = curl_easy_perform(curl);

        if (res != CURLE_OK)
        {
            fprintf(stderr, "curl_easy_perform() failed: %s\n", curl_easy_strerror(res));
        }

        curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
    }

    curl_global_cleanup();

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we include the necessary header files, initialize libcurl using `curl_global_init`, and create a CURL handle using `curl_easy_init`.

We set the URL for the request using `curl_easy_setopt` with the `CURLOPT_URL` option. In this case, we set it to `"https://api.example.com/data"`.

To perform the request, we call `curl_easy_perform` with the CURL handle. If the request is successful, it will return `CURLE_OK`. Otherwise, we output an error message using `curl_easy_strerror`.

Afterwards, we clean up the CURL handle using `curl_easy_cleanup` and call `curl_global_cleanup` to clean up global libcurl resources.

Note that to compile and link against libcurl, you need to have the libcurl library installed on your system and include the appropriate libcurl header files and library during the build process. The steps for building and linking against libcurl may vary depending on your platform and development environment.

<summary>Python</summary>

In Python, you can make HTTP requests using the `requests` library, which provides a simple and intuitive API. Here's an example of making an HTTP GET request:

```python
import requests

url = 'https://api.example.com/data'

try:
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for 4xx or 5xx status codes
    
    data = response.json()  # Extract the JSON response data
    
    # Process the data
    print(data)
    
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print('Error:', e)
```

In this example, we import the `requests` library and specify the URL we want to send a GET request to.

Inside the `try` block, we use `requests.get` to send the request. The resulting `response` object contains the server's response to the request.

We call `response.raise_for_status()` to raise an exception if the response has a 4xx or 5xx status code, indicating an error. This helps to handle errors gracefully.

We can extract the response data as JSON using `response.json()`.

Finally, we process the data as needed. In this example, we simply print the data to the console.

If an exception is raised during the request, we catch it using `requests.exceptions.RequestException` and print an error message.

Ensure that you have the `requests` library installed before running the code. You can install it using pip: `pip install requests`.

<summary>Java</summary>


In Java, you can make HTTP requests using the `java.net.HttpURLConnection` class or by using third-party libraries such as Apache HttpClient or OkHttp. Here's an example of making an HTTP GET request using `java.net.HttpURLConnection`:

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.net.HttpURLConnection;
import java.net.URL;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            URL url = new URL("https://api.example.com/data");
            HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
            
            connection.setRequestMethod("GET");
            
            int responseCode = connection.getResponseCode();
            
            if (responseCode == HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK) {
                BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(connection.getInputStream()));
                String line;
                StringBuilder response = new StringBuilder();
                
                while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                    response.append(line);
                }
                
                reader.close();
                
                // Process the response data
                System.out.println(response.toString());
            } else {
                System.out.println("Error: " + responseCode);
            }
            
            connection.disconnect();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a `URL` object with the desired URL and open a connection to that URL using `url.openConnection()`, which returns an instance of `HttpURLConnection`.

We set the request method to "GET" using `connection.setRequestMethod("GET")`.

We can obtain the response code using `connection.getResponseCode()`. If the response code is `HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK` (which is equal to 200), we read the response body using a `BufferedReader` and process it accordingly.

After processing the response, we close the `BufferedReader` and disconnect the connection using `connection.disconnect()`.

If an exception occurs during the request, we catch it and print the stack trace.

Note that this is a basic example, and in real-world scenarios, you may need to handle various response codes, handle request headers, or perform more complex operations.

<summary>Go</summary>

In Go, you can make HTTP requests using the built-in `net/http` package. Here's an example of making an HTTP GET request:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	url := "https://api.example.com/data"

	response, err := http.Get(url)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error:", err)
		return
	}
	defer response.Body.Close()

	if response.StatusCode == http.StatusOK {
		bodyBytes, err := ioutil.ReadAll(response.Body)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println("Error:", err)
			return
		}
		bodyString := string(bodyBytes)

		// Process the response data
		fmt.Println(bodyString)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Error:", response.StatusCode)
	}
}
```

In this example, we import the necessary packages (`fmt`, `io/ioutil`, and `net/http`) and specify the URL we want to send a GET request to.

We use `http.Get(url)` to send the GET request and obtain the response. The `response` object contains the server's response to the request.

We defer closing the response body using `defer response.Body.Close()` to ensure the body is closed after processing.

If the response status code is `http.StatusOK` (which is equal to 200), we read the response body using `ioutil.ReadAll(response.Body)` and convert it to a string.

Finally, we process the response data as needed. In this example, we simply print the response body string to the console.

If an error occurs during the request, we handle it and print an error message.

You can run the Go code using the `go run` command or build an executable using the `go build` command.

<summary>Batch</summary>

In batch scripting, you can make an HTTP request using the `curl` command-line tool. You can invoke `curl` from your batch script to send HTTP requests to a specified URL. Here's an example of making an HTTP GET request using `curl`:

```batch
@echo off

set url=https://api.example.com/data

curl %url%
```

In this example, we set the `url` variable to the desired URL. You can replace `https://api.example.com/data` with your specific URL.

We use the `curl` command followed by the `%url%` variable to make the HTTP GET request. `curl` will send the request and print the response to the console.

Save the script with a `.bat` extension, and you can execute it from the command prompt or by double-clicking the batch file.

Note that the availability of the `curl` command-line tool depends on your operating system. If `curl` is not installed or not available in the system's PATH, you may need to install it separately or specify the full path to the `curl` executable in your script.

<summary>Lua</summary>

In Lua, you can make HTTP requests using the `LuaSocket` library, which provides networking capabilities. Here's an example of making an HTTP GET request using `LuaSocket`:

```lua
local http = require("socket.http")

local url = "https://api.example.com/data"

local response, status, headers = http.request(url)

if status == 200 then
  -- Process the response body
  print(response)
else
  print("Error:", status)
end
```

In this example, we first require the `socket.http` module to access the HTTP functionality.

We set the `url` variable to the desired URL.

We use `http.request(url)` to send the HTTP GET request and obtain the response. The `response` variable will contain the response body, `status` will contain the response status code, and `headers` will contain the response headers.

If the `status` variable equals `200` (indicating a successful response), we process the `response` body as needed. In this example, we simply print it to the console.

If there is an error or the status code is not `200`, we print an error message along with the `status` code.

Ensure that the `LuaSocket` library is installed and accessible in your Lua environment. You may need to install it separately if it's not already available.

<summary>F#</summary>

In F#, you can make HTTP requests using the `System.Net.Http` namespace, which provides the `HttpClient` class. Here's an example of making an HTTP GET request:

```fsharp
open System
open System.Net.Http

let url = "https://api.example.com/data"

let httpClient = new HttpClient()

async {
    try
        let! response = httpClient.GetAsync(url) |> Async.AwaitTask
        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode()
        let! responseBody = response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync() |> Async.AwaitTask
        // Process the response body
        printfn "%s" responseBody
    with
        | ex -> printfn "Error: %s" ex.Message
}
|> Async.RunSynchronously
```

In this example, we open the necessary namespaces (`System` and `System.Net.Http`) to access the required types and methods.

We set the `url` variable to the desired URL.

We create an instance of `HttpClient` using `new HttpClient()`.

Using the `async` computation expression, we define an asynchronous workflow to make the HTTP request.

Inside the workflow, we use `httpClient.GetAsync(url)` to send the GET request and await the response using `Async.AwaitTask`.

We call `response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode()` to ensure that the response is successful (status code in the 2xx range).

Then, we use `response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync()` to read the response body as a string and await the result using `Async.AwaitTask`.

Finally, we process the response body as needed. In this example, we simply print it to the console using `printfn`.

If an exception occurs during the request, we catch it and print an error message.

We execute the asynchronous workflow using `Async.RunSynchronously` to run it synchronously and obtain the result.

Make sure to reference the `System.Net.Http` assembly in your project to use the `HttpClient` class and include the necessary `open` statements at the beginning of your code.

<summary>Rust</summary>

In Rust, you can make HTTP requests using the `reqwest` crate, which provides a convenient API for sending HTTP requests. Here's an example of making an HTTP GET request:

First, add `reqwest` as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
reqwest = "0.11"
```

Then, you can use the following code to make an HTTP GET request:

```rust
use reqwest;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let url = "https://api.example.com/data";
    
    let response = reqwest::get(url).await?;
    
    if response.status().is_success() {
        let body = response.text().await?;
        
        // Process the response body
        println!("{}", body);
    } else {
        println!("Error: {}", response.status());
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

In this example, we import the `reqwest` crate.

The `main` function is marked as `async` to allow asynchronous operations.

Inside the `main` function, we set the `url` variable to the desired URL.

We use `reqwest::get(url).await?` to send the HTTP GET request and await the response. The `response` object represents the server's response.

We check if the response status is a success status using `response.status().is_success()`. If it is, we read the response body as a string using `response.text().await?`.

Finally, we process the response body as needed. In this example, we simply print it to the console using `println!`.

If an error occurs during the request, it will be propagated up and printed to the console.

To execute the code, you need to use the `tokio` runtime by marking the `main` function with `#[tokio::main]` attribute.

Ensure that you have `reqwest` crate added as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file and run the code using `cargo run`.

<summary>Ruby</summary>

In Ruby, you can make HTTP requests using the `Net::HTTP` standard library. Here's an example of making an HTTP GET request:

```ruby
require 'net/http'
require 'uri'

url = URI.parse('https://api.example.com/data')

http = Net::HTTP.new(url.host, url.port)
http.use_ssl = true if url.scheme == 'https'

request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(url.request_uri)

response = http.request(request)

if response.code.to_i == 200
  body = response.body
  
  # Process the response body
  puts body
else
  puts "Error: #{response.code} #{response.message}"
end
```

In this example, we require the necessary libraries: `net/http` for making HTTP requests and `uri` for parsing the URL.

We parse the URL using `URI.parse`, providing the desired URL as a string.

We create an instance of `Net::HTTP` using `Net::HTTP.new`, passing the host and port extracted from the URL.

If the URL scheme is `https`, we set `http.use_ssl = true` to enable SSL/TLS for secure connections.

We create an HTTP GET request using `Net::HTTP::Get.new`, passing the request URI extracted from the URL.

We send the request using `http.request(request)` and obtain the response.

If the response status code is `200` (indicating a successful response), we extract the response body using `response.body`.

Finally, we process the response body as needed. In this example, we simply print it to the console using `puts`.

If the response status code is not `200`, we print an error message including the response code and message.

To run the code, make sure you have Ruby installed, and execute the script using `ruby script_name.rb`.

<summary>CoffeeScript</summary>

CoffeeScript is a language that compiles into JavaScript, so you can use JavaScript libraries and syntax to make HTTP requests. In CoffeeScript, you can make an HTTP request using the `XMLHttpRequest` object or by using libraries such as `axios` or `fetch`. Here's an example using the `XMLHttpRequest` object:

```coffeescript
xhr = new XMLHttpRequest()
url = 'https://api.example.com/data'

xhr.onreadystatechange = ->
  if xhr.readyState == 4
    if xhr.status == 200
      # Process the response
      console.log(xhr.responseText)
    else
      console.log("Error:", xhr.status)

xhr.open('GET', url, true)
xhr.send()
```

In this example, we create a new `XMLHttpRequest` object using `new XMLHttpRequest()`.

We set the `url` variable to the desired URL.

We define the `onreadystatechange` event handler, which is triggered when the state of the request changes. We check if the `readyState` is 4 (indicating that the request is complete) and if the `status` is 200 (indicating a successful response).

Inside the event handler, we process the response by accessing the `responseText` property of the `xhr` object and logging it to the console.

If the `status` is not 200, we log an error message along with the `status` code.

We open the request using `xhr.open('GET', url, true)`, specifying the HTTP method, URL, and `true` to make it an asynchronous request.

Finally, we send the request using `xhr.send()`.

You can compile the CoffeeScript code into JavaScript using a CoffeeScript compiler such as `coffee` or an online tool, and then run the resulting JavaScript code in a browser or a JavaScript runtime environment.
